Version Controlled Database
===========================

This repository contains files to facilitate version controlling a PostgresSQL
database.

The following commands:
    `docker-compose exec db db_dump`
    `docker-compose exec db db_load`
...dump the database in the db docker container to a file in incubator-superset/db.

The following scripts:
    `pre-commit`
    `post-merge`
    `post-checkout`
...should be added to your incubator-superset/.git/hooks.  This will make git
automatically ask you if you want to commit db changes to git and load db changes
from git.  If you prefer to do this manually that is fine.
